Even if you have little to no experience with Angular, I'll be more than happy to help. :)

4. If you don't have Angular CLI installed: `npm install -g angular-cli@latest`
5. `ng init`
6. Type `n` for each file to not overwrite any file changes
7. Run `npm start` and open `localhost:4200` in a browser
8. Work your magic
9. Run `npm run build` or `npm run static-serve` to kick off a production build and make sure nothing is broken
10. To test service worker changes:
  * `npm run build` to kick off a fresh build and update the `dist/` directory
